Internet & interanet  Haas,PaaS,IaaS,SaaS, why Cloud computing,why router single line definition
NIC ,ethernet adapter,LAN card(10/100/1000mbps) 
Repeater ->from onwards 100m we need repeater cause LAN ceases to operate
Hubs(10mbps)->concetrate connections.In other words  simple hub(passive hub)non-intelligent hub(as it asks for where to broadcast every single time before trnsfering dat)
switch(100mbps) physically similar2Hub-> 8,16,24,32 ports.when it is on switch has a table with the ip addresses of devices.Active Hub(as it is an intelligent device) as it not only
Router->can do almost everything as above.Helps in creating a communication between two different networks.
192->broadband are pre-configured as 192 itself.check ur lappy's ipv4 at cmd by ipconfig mine is 192(preferred)itself.wifi and cable both have lan card.ipconfig all
Dynamic Host confuguration protocol(Default Gateway)->when IP(public->global)add given by the server   ip address allot by modem 192(private->local)
we get ip from modem(2 ip addresses)    @ address bar what is my ipv4 add when isp assigned me public ip 49(public ip->then only hackers can access my system) add that ip2address bar
you get jio/airtel username admin and password is itself.U can change dhcp's ip series

compute+keyboard+mouse->PAN
internet->Wide area network
1->OSI->Layered architecture data moves from one layer to another with respect to the processing.The user always works on the 7th Application layer. ' . from the user the seventh layer would be physical layer.
.Each layer performs specific operations thereby dividing overall objective into simpler tasks.Single networking tasks are done this way.Physical layer->Hubs 
Data-Link layer can't understand what the presentation layer processes.Phy can't under App.But Session+App=Presentation.every layer has its own defined set of protocols for receiving and sending data.

Physical layer converts:voltage||Electronic signals->it sets up bit(4incoming msgs) streams across networks.bits to electronic signals(4outgoingMsgs).It manages the interface b/t the computer&the physical medium of the network.It 
(Connectors,wiresVoltages,DataRates)       constitutes the foundation4the driver software of the units such as NICs.Deals with modems,hubs(repeater),connectors

Data-Link Layer->It sets up links across physical network handles SPECIAL data frames(or packets) b/tNetwork layer&thePhysical layer.@receiver's end,this layer converts raw-data coming from the physical into data frame format,2B passed on further
                           to the network layer while @sender's end it converts DFs->raw-data format which gets passed on further2the physical layer.Provides a reliable data transfer via media;physical address network topology
                           flow control&error notification

Network Layer ->manages addressing4the msgs2 b delivered& manages routing of this data.Performs transaction of logic network addresses&names into their physical equivalents.Decides routing network traffic b/t computers.Manages packet swictching
                          &deals with network congestion.It basically provides connectivity&path selection; routing domian. It is the layer of intelligent devices like router&AppFirewall.

Transport Layer->enables transmission of data across a network 4 end2end communication.Performs Segmention of long data units into smaller segments called as packets(ususally based on the bandwidth/allowed packet size4the involved medium 
of transition Assembling&performs squencing of data chunks arriving at the receiver.Provides confirmation of successful transmissions&signals4resending the erroneous data packets.It enables the transfer of a messageb/t 
the processes.It manages the data transportation between hosts,establish,maintain&terminate virtual circuits;info flow control;error detection&recovery.

CMD-- netstat -a(4all type of connection)

SessionL->Used2interhost communicationHelps in identifying&managing communication channel(termed as a session)b/t two devices over a network.App on either end of the session are able2communication4the duration of the valid session.
Resposible for initiating,maintaining&terminating sessions.Resposible4security&access control2session information(via session participant identification).Responsible4synchronization services&4the checkpoint services
It basically establishes,maintains&terminates logical sessions b/t apps||borwsers &servers.Gateway

PresPurpose->4Data representation&encrytpion/decryption
Presentation->manages data-format info(serves as translator),4outgoing msgs,converts Dinto a generic format4network transmission4incoming msgs,it converts data from the generic network format2format that receiving applciation
can understand; It is responsible 4conversion protoc,data encryption/decryption,||data compression/decomression.A special soft facility-redirector operates at this layer.It determines if a request is network related||not&forwards network related
requests2 an appropriate network resource.     It ensures the data is readable by the receiving system;manages format of the data&its structure&syntax for application layer.Gateway

ApplicationL->Top layer which provides a set of interfaces4sending&receiving applications&2 use network services,such as:  Msg handling , DB query processing.It is responsible4providing services2the end-user.Used2process application
It offers netowrk services like email,terminal emulation,file transfer,etc.Ex the CLI where i can ping google by typing the cmd ping google.com -t.Then i'll b able to see the ICMP traffic.Which tries to reach the ip||the host name.Gateway

The user accesses the network resources by means of this applicaiton layer->the data shared by the user is translated,encrypted(De)&compressed(De) by the Presentation->a connection is established b/t the app&the server&this session is created&managed 
by the session layer-> the data is divided into smaller chunks() whose error recovery&successful delivery2 the networklayer is Transport Layer's responsibility->Netowork.Here sender's and receiver's addresses(including header&driller info)are attached to 
the units of data(packet).->DataLink here the packets are further decomposed into frames,organized from bits and also provides hop2hop delivery->transmit bits over a medium(LAN wires) originally created from the conversion of Electrical signal.Also provide
mechanichal and electrical signals.

2->Explian TCP/IP model with OSI model :
TCP(4) while OSI(7)
TCP/IP AppL(4) == OSI App(7th)+PresL(6th)+SessL(5th)
TCP/IP InterL(2) == OSI Network(3rd)
Lower layer Network layer TCP/IP has similar functions as OSI Model's lower 2 layers(Phyical&Data-LinkL)
Bits(physical)->the language which a computer system understands.0:no charge   1: +vely charged
Frame(DL)->Bunch of data created by network communincation hardware.Ex-NIC,router interfaces at DL lyer
Ethernet(802.3)&Wifi(802.11) frame format->Src,Des&Router Mac Address.4TCP/IP communcations payload4frame.It is the actual information being shared b/t src&des, whose size-limit is 02 2312 bytes.(byte=8bits. ' . max-18496 bits).CRC,durationSequence control&
frame control.

Network Packet=EthernetHeader>IPheader>TCPheader>DATA/payload
Steam of binary octets of data of some arbitrary length,typically used2 describe chunks of data created by software components
DATA=APP+PRESENTAION+SESSION   
Segments(received from sessoins layer is in the form of chunks.TrnasportL) ->Chunk of data that has been prepared4TCP.Usually a segment is a chopped||manageable 'data stream'
Data->Thsi is the generic term that is often used while describing protocols that function at higher levels,usually the network layer&up.
