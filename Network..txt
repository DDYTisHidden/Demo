Reasons why this model came into existence :This 7 layered OSI model was introduced in 1984to accomplish a successful communication b/t computers/networks 
of different architecture.Each of these layers is a package of protocols.Application does!have any concerns with computer applications like Chrome
Firefox.Instead it has a set of protocols(HTTPandHTTPs) which enable these app(s) to work correctly in a network/internet.  
to allow differnt types of nework hardware and software to communicatewith each other 
Avoid  
duplication of equipment resources ;
 inability to communicate efficiently 
to break network commmunication into smaller , simpler parts that are easy to develop 
to facilitate standardization of network 
Router : works with network address not with IP address i.e. network layer
Switch : data link layer
data cable hub : Physical layer
1>Application layer allow access to network resources and applications which require net(Chrome,Outlook,Skype,router, web server , file server or 
database server).All these applications do not reside in the App. Layer but use its application protocols to function(HTPP,HTTPs) and to do web 
surfing These protocols allow the basis of network services like file transfer(FTP) , web surfing(HTTP/S), emails(SMTP) ,virtual Terminals(Telnet)
 etc at Server's end encyption and compress protocols 
(i) FTP (iv)HTTPS(vi)DHCP(ix)TELNET
(ii)SNMP(v)NFS(vii)NNTP(x)FMTP
(iii)HTTP (vi)IRC(viii)POP3
2>Presentation layer: Recieves data from the application layer which is in the format of characters and numbers.This layer converts this data into a
mahcine understandable format i.e. binary form(i.e.1>Translation ex-ASCII->EBCDIC).Before the data is transfered P layer reduces the no. of bits used
2 represent the original data(or 2>Data compression which is either lossy/lossless).This layer reduces the the size occupied by the file thereby facilitating
its faster transfer(data transmission) to the destination.However in order to maintain the integrity of the data , before its transmission , P layer 
performs 3>encyption .This enhances the security of sensitive data.That is to say that at the sender's side the data is encrypted and at the reveiver's 
side , 3>decrypted.Both of these operations are carried out by Secure Sockets Layer protocol in this layer.
3>Session Layer: This layer helps the set-up&management of the connection enabling sending and receiving of data; followed by the termination 
of the connnections(sessions).For this the session layer adopts the usage of APIs(ex-Network Basic Input Output System)which allows applications
on different 
computers to communicate with one other.Before a session or connection of a server with a machine,the server performs 1>authentication
by asking 4 username and password.Once the correct password and username is entered a session gets established b/t ur computer and server.Post
authenticating the user, 2>autherization is performed to determine if the user has permission to access some file.if ! error msg u r ! authorized.This 
layer keeps a track of the files being dowloaded.These files are received as data packets.The S layer keeps a track of these packets as to know which
packet belongs to .txt category and which to the .img category.These text files and img files are stored as seperate files on the web server.On being
requested the web server establishes a seperate session for this purpose so that they can be downloaded seperately depending on their file format
/extention because as mentioned before the data received as  packets are dowloaded either as text file or image file.These packets are tracked for
their destination which is browser in this casei.e.this layer accounts for 3>session management .
The browser accounts for the functions performed by the Sess,Pre&Appl.  
Transport layer:controls the reliability of the network by the following measures :
Segmentation :The data from the session layer is divided into smaller data units(segments) each with a source&destination's port no(To direct each of these seg
-ments to the correct applications.And a sequence no.(for re-assembling the segments into the correct order 4 constiuting a corr. msg at the reveiver
-'s end
Flow Control:This is for controlling the amount of data being transmitted.4 instance consider a smartphone connected 2 a server which can transmit
data at max of 100mbps while the mobile can process it max at 10mps.Therefore, if a case arises when the mobile starts downloading data from 
the server which sends it at 50mbs then the phone can use the transport layer to tell the server to decrease the data transmission rate.Vice versa 
is possible too
Error C:The role of this layer comes into play when some data(singular datum)does not arrive at the destination.Then the transport layer uses the 
Automatic Repeat Request scheme to re-transmit the lost/corrupted data.A group of bits(checksum) is added to each segment by the transport lyer
to check for the received corrupted segment.T layer is represented by two protocols :
Transmission control protocol(TCP 4 Connection-oriented Transmission service which is fast because no feedback is delivered4 data-delivery ex-
online movie streaming,music,online video games,voice over,IP,TFTP,DNS where complete data delivery is not important)
User datagram(A self-contained message unit whihc contains sufficient)protocol(4Connectionless Transmission service slow because it provides 
feedback for the probably lost data in TCP so that it can be re-transmitted.Here complete data-delivery is must.Ex-www,email,FTP) 
from the source if the frame is transmitted three cases arise : (i) frame arrived along with acknowledgement
						(ii) frame dropped
		(iii) frame arrived without acknowledgement therefore cosidered as dropped
Network Layer:The segments transfered by the tranport layer which accounts for the transmission of the data between computer located on different
networks.However here the data units R referred to as packets&this is the layer where routers reside.Following are its func(s)LAdd,Rout,PathDeter:
(1)IP addressing done in the network layer is referred to as LAdd.Every device has a uniques IP add in a network.The N layer assigns sender's&re
-ceiver's ip address to each segment to form an ip packet.These ipadd. R assigned to ensure that each packet receives its correct destination
(2)It is the process of transfering data packets form source2destination with respect2 the logical address of the format(IPv4&IPv6+Mask).
Suppose a A and B r 2 devices connected 2 2 different networks.When A communicates with the server of FB(2 access it)then the reply from its 
server is in the form a packet which has the sender's and receiver's ipadd i.e. of the device A.Suppose if mask is 255.255.255.0. then the first 3 comb
represents the network while the rest represents the host.Since the ipadd r unique ,the received data packet is transmitted first to the network followed
by the host device.
(3)Path Determination:The mechanism of determining the best possible path for data delivery between a computer(source)&a server(|| other 
computer(s)destination)is called PD.This is cause a computer can be connected to a server in a no. of different ways.Layer 3 devices use following 
protocols 2 serve this purpose :
$OpenShortestPathFirst
$BorderGatewayProtocol
$IntermediateSystem2IntermediateSystem
Data Link L:It receives packets from the Network layer.These packets contain ip addresses of the sender and reciever.LogicalAdd. is done in the 
network layer where sender's and receiver's ipadd are assigned2the segment constiuting a data packet.In the DataL layer PhysicalAdderessing is 
done where MACadd(sender's&receiver's) are assigned to each packet(which is a twelve digit alphanumeric no. embedded in Network Interface 
Card by our computer manufacturer )constituing a frame.Data unit in DataLink L is called a frame.This layer itself is embedded as software in 
our NI card.These frames serve as a medium 4 transmitting data from one computer 2 the other via a local media.Local media includes Cu wire,
Optical fibre||air4radio signals.Media refers2 the physical linksb/t2||>devices/networks.1stFunc to permit the above layer2access media by techniqs
like framing.2ndFunc 2 control how data is fetched/received from media and how it is placed by means of MediaAccessControl and ErrorDetection
Consider two hosts(laptop&Desktop) in different networks communicating with each other.Being on N1&N2 netwo. ' .they will be N layer protocols
IP 4 instance 4 communicating with one other.Consider the desktop connected2 router1 via ethernetCable->R12R2 via a sattellite link&R2connected
2 laptop via a wireless link.If Desktop wishes2share some data2Laptop;depending on the medium used2connect it with R1,the DL layer assigns some 
additional data to the head&tail of the ipPacket converting it2a data-frame.R1 receives this ethernetFrame,de-capsulates it into an ip packet&re-ca
-psualtes it back into a data-frame4 transmitting it accross the satellite link.R2 de-capsulates the frame followed by its de-capsualtion2form a wire
-less data-link frame.This WLDL frame is de-capsulated by the laptop and forwards it to the NLayer.Finally the data unit arrives the AppLicayer
which uses protocols2makes the received data visible on laptop's screenI.E.the Network layer||higher level layer are able2transfer data over media
with the help of DLLayer;this is what it means when it is said that DLL layer allows access2media4 higher level layer of the OSI model.The techn
-ique used to get a frame on and off the media(LanCable,Opticalfiber,Air) is referred2as mediaAccessControl.If various devices are connected to the 
same media&they send data at the same time then there mayba possibility that it can lead2msgCollision producing a useless msg which can't b 
understood by any of the recipient.2avoid this the DLL keeps an eye on when the sharing media is free so that device can transmit data to the 
recevier->calledCarrierSendsMultipleAccess.That is DLL uses MediaAccessControl to monitor data transmission.Tail of each frame contains bits(4E
rrorDetection)in the received frame.These errors can arise due2certain limitation of the media used4DataTransmission.
segment=Data(Transport)<Packet=(Source+DestinIP)+segment(Network)<Frame=(Source+DestiMAC)+Packet+FCS(DL)which is a seq.of 0s&1s
PhysicalL:This layer converts these binary sequence into signals&transmit it over local media which can be an electric signal in case of Cu/LAN
cable,Light signal in case of Optical fibre||radio signal in case of air.This implies that the signal produced by theP-Layer depends upon the kind of
medium used2connect2devices.At the receiver's end the P-Layer receives signals->convert it in2 bits and pass it to the DLlayer as a frame.This frame
further gets decapsulated as data shifts across higher layer.Finally data moves to the AppLayer whose protocols makes the contents of the sender's 
message visible on the application of the receiver's computer screen.This is how OSI model helps in transferring data between 2||< hosts on different
networks.
The distance vector routing we assume that each router knows the identity of every other router in the network.But the shortest path to each orouter
is not knownA distance vector is defined as the list of destination,cost touples,one touple per destination.Each router mainains a distance vector
the cost in each touple is equal is to the sum of costs on the shortest path to the destination.
Updation of Router tables 
1>A router periodically sends a copy of its distance vector to all its neighbours
2>When a router receives a distance vector form its neighbour ,it determines whether its cost to reach any destination could decrease if it routes
packets to the destinations through that neighbour.
3>A single takes place at all other routers as well   
the problem with distance vector its slowness in converging to the correct answer.This is due ot the found to infinity problem.It can be solved by 
split Horizon Problem.
Split Horizon algo : int this algo the minimum cost to a given destination is not sent through a neighbour if the neighbour is the next node along 
the shortest path.4ex- if node a thinks that the best route to node b is via node c then node a should not sent the corresponding minimum cost to node
C 
to avoid the count to infinity problem but only 
this algo does not take the line bandwidth into consideration while choosing route.This serious problem lead to its replacement by 
Top to infinity pro
the distance vetor routing works properly theoritically but not practically .It produces a correct result but slowly
it reacts quickly to good news but if a router goes down it reacts very slowly(i.e. works fast only when router is up)
Consider a linear subnet which has five nodes the delay matrix used is the no. of hops.Assume that a 
each router should discover and obtain each others network addresses of the neighbouring routers
the delay or cost of these neighbours measure round-trip delay of Hello packet and its reply 
it should construct a packet containing the network address and the delays of all these neighbours 
lastly compute the shortest path to each router 
the complete topology and all the details are experimentally measured and this information is conveyed to each and every router 
then a shortest path algo(DJkruskal's algo/code ))can be used to every 
the open shourtest first protocol(OSPF) which is used in Internet uses linked 
IS-IS intermediate system-" same" is the other protocol which uses linked state protocol.it is used in internet 
comparison between linked state routeing and distance vector routing :
distance vector routing 
each router contains routing table,index,and contianing one entry for each router 
algo takes too long to converge                                                                          link state converging fast
                                                                                                                       band width is available
each router measure delay directly with special eco packets                                 all delays measured&destributed 
it considers 
Hierarchical routing
as the size of the network incresaess the size o fthe routing table also increases as a result of large routing table , a large routing memory is consumed
most cpu time is needed to scanning the table
in broadcasting a host sends packets to many/all other hosts of the network
